**Week challenges (Tuesday)**


1. Base on this reading and this video, create an explanation about Interpreted And Compiled.

- A compiler translates the entire source code faster. An interpreter translates the entire source code line by line slower. There are some advantages and disadvantages for each process.  

- *Read more about this on this article* [Compiler and Interpreter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/)


2. Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?

- Java is a compiled programming language, but rather than compile straight to executable machine code, it compiles to an intermediate binary form called JVM byte code. The byte code is then compiled and/or interpreted to run the program.
