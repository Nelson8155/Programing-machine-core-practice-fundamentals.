# Programming-machine-core-practice-fundamentals.

**Week challenges (Tuesday)**


1. ### Base on this reading and this video, create an explanation about Interpreted And Compiled.

- A compiler translates the entire source code faster. An interpreter translates the entire source code line by line slower. There are some advantages and disadvantages for each process.  

- *Read more about this on this article* [Compiler and Interpreter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/)


2. ### Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?

- Java is a compiled programming language, but rather than compile straight to executable machine code, it compiles to an intermediate binary form called JVM byte code. The byte code is then compiled and/or interpreted to run the program.

- In other words, we can say that it uses both, complied and Interpreted [1. Resource](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Why-java-is-both-compiled-and-interpreted-language) [2.

3. ### Pseudocode Currency Converter exercise.

* Starting point: START
* Input: READ, GET
* Output: PRINT
* Math: +, -, *, /
* Assignation: <--
* Initialize: SET, INIT
* Add one: INCREMENT
* End point: END.

> START 

* DOLLAR <-- GET
* BC <-- 23258.30
* CONVERSION <-- DOLLAR / BC
* PRINT CONVERSION

>END

> START 

* BC <--  GET
* DOLLAR <-- 23258.30
* CONVERSION <-- BC * DOLLAR
* PRINT CONVERSION

>END

4. ### Learn about High and Low level languages


    1. ### Low level Languages

- Low-level languages can convert to machine code without a compiler or interpreter – second-generation programming languages use a simpler processor called an assembler – and the resulting code runs directly on the processor. A program written in a low-level language can be made to run very quickly, with a small memory footprint. 

    2. ### High level Languages
