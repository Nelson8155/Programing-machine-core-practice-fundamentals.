3. ### Read about: if...else

- The if/else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed. The if/else statement is a part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

> Example:

- Write a function named greaterNum that:
takes 2 arguments, both numbers.
returns whichever number is the greater (higher) number.
Call that function 2 times with different number pairs, and log the output to make sure it works (e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10.").

```JavaScript

function greaterNum(num1, num2) {
    if (num1 > num2) {
        return num1;
    } else {
        return num2;
    }
}

console.log(greaterNum(5, 10));
VM242:9 10
```

4. ### Read about: for

- In programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code. For example, if you want to show a message 100 times, then you can use a loop. It's just a simple example; you can achieve much more with loops. This tutorial focuses on JavaScript for loop.

> Example:

- Let’s start by displaying some text several times until our condition is met.

```JavaScript

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  let name = "John Doe";
  console.log("Hi, my name is " + name);
}
```

5. ### Read about: while

- The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.

> Example:

- Example 1: Display Numbers from 1 to 5

```JavaScript

// program to display numbers from 1 to 5
// initialize the variable
let i = 1, n = 5;

// while loop from i = 1 to 5
while (i <= n) {
    console.log(i);
    i += 1;
}
```

6. ### Read about: functions

- A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.

> Example:

```JavaScript

Example 1: Display a Text
// program to print a text
// declaring a function
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello there!");
}

// calling the function
greet();

//Output

Hello there!
```
